<p>I am a visual learner, an INFJ-T, and a science and technology oriented person. I often express my ideas more effectively in written form as opposed to verbally. I am somewhat perfectionistic in nature and in my approach to completing tasks. My diligent nature is also coupled with a tendency to burn out, as well as a certain level of sensitivity to criticism.<p>
