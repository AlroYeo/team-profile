I am a visual learner, an INFJ-T, and a science and technology oriented person. 
I often express my ideals more effectively in written form as opposed to verbally. 
I am somewhat perfectionistic in nature and in my approach to completing tasks. 
My diligence is also coupled with a tendency to burn out, as well as a certain level of sensitivity to criticism.
